# my-first-website
This repo will get you started building your own website using github pages.

To get set up, first you will need a github account, so register [here](https://github.com/join) or login, then click the Fork button at the top of this page. ![fork button](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

This creates your very own copy (or repository) of the site in your own area, where you can do whatever you like with it.

You will need to find your own version of the repo, this will be at `https://github.com/<your_username>/my-first-website` - go into settings, and change the Repository name to `<your_username>.github.io`. Then you can go back to the code and alter it, either by checking it out to your own machine, or by using github's own code editor.

### I want my own URL, not a github one

You can do that too! I recommend [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) for their prices and simple ability to customise where the site points to, but any domain name provider should be able to do this.

If you use nameCheap, their guide is a pretty good way to get your domain pointing to the right place.  [https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages]
